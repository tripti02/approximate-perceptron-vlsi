# Approximate Perceptron VLSI Design

A hardware-efficient perceptron implementation using **approximate 8Ã—8 multipliers**, designed, synthesized, and verified using **UMC 65nm technology**. This project was part of a summer internship at **IIT Guwahati** under the guidance of **Prof. Roy Paily Palathinkal**.

---

## Project Overview

This project explores **Approximate Computing** to reduce area, power, and delay in hardware implementations of neural networks. We designed multiple 8Ã—8 approximate multipliers and integrated them into a **perceptron** model. The entire system was evaluated for image processing applications like **smoothing** and **edge detection**, and also tested on the **MNIST dataset**.

##  Key Features

-  Custom 8Ã—8 approximate multipliers (N8-L1, N8-L2, N8-5, N8-6)
-  Reduced power and area with minimal accuracy loss
-  Simulation and synthesis using Verilog + Synopsys
-  Designed and tested with UMC 65nm technology
-  Applied to image smoothing, edge detection & MNIST digit recognition
